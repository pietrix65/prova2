00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,140
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,630
Welcome to this video.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:08,320
In this story are you going to integrate get into Android studio.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,310
So now let's go ahead and create a new project and choose empty activity.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,560
So let's name the project to be good.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,580
Android studio.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,850
So just typing here to get Android studio and then the package name the save location path make sure

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,640
that the language is Java.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,540
You can choose Castine if you want.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:37,040
Because in this project we just want to integrate the kit into Android studio so we don't want to write

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,810
Java code here or cotton coats and a minimum API level is going to be 16 API 16 and click on finish.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,450
So now let me click on.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:47,930
Yes.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,360
And these experiments are a great great feature.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
Now let's go ahead and let's see.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,890
Let's actually test the gate so that we can be sure that they get is actually installed on our computer.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,420
So if you don't have that get installed on your computer you need to go ahead and download and install

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,820
it.

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:14,340
And when you actually Dan Lothian raid the studio they get also comes with Andrew the studio and you

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,230
already have that get on your computer.

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,920
But it's better to test.

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,920
So let's go ahead and click on file.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,130
If you are using Mac just click on Android to suit your preferences.

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,640
And here click on settings next.

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,840
Go ahead and click on version control here.

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,850
Open it and then choose.

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,500
Get up.

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
Just click on it.

29
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,000
Now here it does not get Harbach counts added.

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,120
So we need to first add an archetype account to Android studio.

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,140
So just click on an account here.

32
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,730
So the server is get hot that's come.

33
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,920
Now you need to enter our username and password here.

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,760
And when you enter your credentials click on luggin And if you don't have a good account you need to

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,670
go ahead and create one.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,790
So just click on and log in.

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,390
Now we should wait here so here you can see my account is added to Android studio here.

38
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:14,700
So now that we have added our account to Android studio here below is version control.

39
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,290
If you open it you can see these kids.

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,880
If you click on it here it is the path to today kids start a fire inside my computer and if you click

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,600
on the test button here it's gonna show you a success message and it's going to give you the version

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,980
of the key.

43
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,330
It's sort of I just need to click on OK.

44
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,350
So now I am sure that the kit is installed on my computer.

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,980
Let's go ahead and click on apply or.

46
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,910
OK so now everything is fine.

47
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:49,260
So now in order to share our project and get up at the top and you have this option VC it's just going

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,010
to click on it.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,290
And then here you can see some options.

50
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,200
For example we have the local history enable version control integration wiseass operations pop up and

51
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,380
some other options.

52
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,840
Let's go ahead and go into the import into Version control and then we have this option that says share

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,990
project and get up let's click on it and let's wait a little bit here.

54
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,520
So here it's going to create a repository for us and get up.

55
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,380
So it is giving us this repository name as a suggestion.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,980
You can if you want you can change it.

57
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,320
Get Android studio.

58
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,330
So this is the name of our project so you can also check the search box if you want your product to

59
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,980
be private.

60
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,590
We have the remote here the remote name and the description.

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,580
So about 30 modes and the description for now let's just click on share.

62
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,550
So here we have something really interesting.

63
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,070
We have this window that says at Feis for initial coming so we don't have to write code here command

64
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:54,090
line codes here we just need to interact with this application and just click on OK and then come it

65
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,650
will be executed.

66
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,000
So here not is that it is actually committing all of these files here.

67
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,940
So because this our initial commit of this project I suggest that you do actually commit all of these

68
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:16,250
files to a central repository because of this in our central repository we don't have these files.

69
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,170
So first make sure that you put all of these files into the get hub and then event later when you for

70
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,520
example change a specific file.

71
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,940
For example you may only change main activity class so in that case you only want to commit to the main

72
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,920
activity class.

73
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,320
You don't have to for example commits the grateful codes.

74
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,400
Or maybe the MIF map folder or the driver folder.

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,380
So here make sure that all of these checkboxes are checked.

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,220
And later when you don't want it for example a specific file to be committed you just need to uncheck

77
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,790
that checkbox of a specific folder or a file.

78
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,000
And here we have the commit message remember.

79
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,950
So I'm gonna say get Android studio first come.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,470
OK.

81
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,750
Now let's go ahead and click on.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,260
OK.

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,100
Now it's pushing to get harbormaster.

84
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,890
This is going to be our master branch here at the bottom.

85
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,610
And if you click on it you can see that background tasks that is being executed.

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,210
So here we have this message that says successfully shared project and get up.

87
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,590
And here we have this link to get Android to you.

88
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm going to click on it.

89
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,470
So here it is our remote repository and get up.

90
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,580
This is the name of our repository kids Android studio.

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,990
And then here these are our Android studio files.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,570
You can see here all the cradle files.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,550
So inside the app folder for example if you click on it you can see it is fine.

94
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,060
RC The source may.

95
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,700
And then here you can see the job folder.

96
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,640
If I click on it here it is our main main activity that job.

97
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,600
And here you can see all the codes here.

98
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,010
So everything is working perfectly.

99
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,260
So the branch is the master.

100
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,180
Right.

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,620
And let's go ahead and just click on Android studio.

102
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,200
So this is our project in.

103
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:12,260
Get up and we could successfully by just adding our accounts to an android studio and then using the

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:21,050
vicissitude we could commit our project here and here it is a snapshot of our project on get up.

105
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,100
So now if you go back to Andrew Estadio you can see that at the top menu here in say the spot below

106
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,890
the start menu.

107
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,150
We have some new icons.

108
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,210
We have this good section.

109
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,240
And the first icon here is to update the project.

110
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,430
And the second icon is to commit to our changes.

111
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,260
So if we go ahead and click on it now it's going on.

112
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:53,710
Give me the files that are not actually committed in the previous comment or maybe the modified files.

113
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,700
So for example if I go ahead.

114
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,250
So here when I wanted to close that window it is advised to get.

115
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,810
Do you want to add the following file to get.

116
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,480
So here this file this vitiates that examen file is added recently.

117
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,980
So here we can actually go ahead and at this five this vicious that there is a fight to get up.

118
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,940
So I just need to click on.

119
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,590
Yes.

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,810
And now let's say this main activity class let's add a new line of code here inside is uncreate method.

121
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:28,970
So I'm going to say lock that so first we need to specify the TAC comma and then I'm going inside the

122
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,640
code to step in here message semicolon.

123
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,340
Now if we modify our main activity class now here inside this section I'm going to Caly can come in

124
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:45,840
it does come into icon and here it says that the main activity class here is changed.

125
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,790
We can't come in.

126
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:53,270
So here we can see this lock statement that we added to the uncreate Meffert of their main activity

127
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,380
class and here inside this section you can see all the files that should be committed.

128
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,620
The main activity class should be committed.

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,220
So it is one added one might one modify it.

130
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,380
So now we can go ahead and commit our changes.

131
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,240
So that is that when it says one that it is related to these vitiates that exemplified that we added

132
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,730
to their staging area so we can go ahead and click on commit so here it says please specify come with

133
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,150
message.

134
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,530
So that's why I told you that you must specify a message for your Kemet.

135
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,120
So I'm going to say main activity and Vizier's

136
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,820
exemplified.

137
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,310
So for example this is my message.

138
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,430
You can name it whatever you want.

139
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,060
And here I just need to click on Kermit.

140
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,270
So now it has two files committed main activity Rizzi as exemplified committed.

141
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:58,580
So Claymates means that now we have our new snapshot of this project of this gets Android studio project.

142
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:06,860
Now we can go ahead and push this snapshot this commit to the central repository or to the remote repository.

143
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:15,200
This update projects I'm going to click on it and here we have some options we have for example using

144
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,980
marriage rebase here it is branch the fall.

145
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,720
So we're going to use that Master branch here.

146
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,700
We have the stash and Shell.

147
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:31,910
So stash is actually for example we have some unfinished changes in our project and we want to save

148
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,110
it.

149
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,480
And then for example applied later.

150
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,000
So stash helps us to use this feature to apply our unfinished changes later.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,020
So just check this check box don't worry about this one here.

152
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,530
The branch is going to be difficult.

153
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,120
And I just want to go ahead and click on OK.

154
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,800
So now it says that all files are up to date.

155
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,390
So in order to push our project to the central repository we need to go ahead and click on the commit

156
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,530
again here.

157
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,510
So it says no changes detected.

158
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,290
Right.

159
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,120
So I'm going to change something here so I'm just going to copy this line of code and paste it here

160
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,490
again and then I'm going to go ahead and click on it.

161
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,210
So because we have a new change here I am going to come with my changes here.

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,360
But if you hover over this button and click on this dropdown we have two other options.

163
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,570
We have come out and push we have create patch.

164
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,900
So if you go ahead and click on come it and push let's see what happens.

165
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,060
So now it's going to add to the project to that master branch.

166
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,230
So now we have two committees.

167
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,100
This is the previous commit and we had the busiest that exemplified remember.

168
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,930
And this is our latest committee.

169
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,970
So here in this committee we added a second a lock statement.

170
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:50,750
OK.

171
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:58,340
So now I'm going to select both of these commits and into skilly can push and you can see that it says

172
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,500
push successful push to come it's to region master to the master branch.

173
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:13,750
So now if you go ahead so here if you go ahead and open that remote repository get Andrew in studio.

174
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,420
Let's go ahead and just refresh this page here.

175
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm going to go ahead and open the app folder and sarcy main and then up let's get it back go back to

176
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,410
main and then click on this Java package and main activity that Java.

177
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,130
So here you should see the two lines of code that are added here.

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,900
And also if you go ahead and click on come it's here.

179
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,960
So if I click on get Andrew Android studio here we have free comets right.

180
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,380
If you go ahead and click on Kermit's you can see all of these comments here.

181
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,880
So here it this is our first comment.

182
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,090
We have our second Cometh and we have this one.

183
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,680
So our first coming out is actually for 20 minutes ago.

184
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,830
Second time it's 12 minutes ago and our latest commit is in three minutes ago.

185
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,510
So in our second comment here we only had one line of code one LUGG statement.

186
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,770
And if I click on back and here it is our latest coming out here we can see that we have to look statements.

187
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,870
So when I say come it I mean different snapshots of the project.

188
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:35,300
So hopefully that makes sense and make sure that you always always use come in all of your projects.

189
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:42,590
It doesn't matter if it is whether it is a practice project or a test project or your complex project.

190
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,590
You should always use Get up get and get up and always come into your changes and create snapshots out

191
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:55,230
of your project because you are going to just make the process of the debarking very easy.

192
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,960
And we have another way to push our changes to the good repository So for example if I go ahead and

193
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:10,520
copy this line of code here and paste it here so I'm going to change it to my message and here at the

194
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,110
top menu.

195
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,800
Just go ahead and click on vicis and then he'll go to get.

196
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,960
So here we have all of these operations.

197
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,630
So we have come to find and we have the reverse option.

198
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,170
We have branches.

199
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,230
And here we have marriage changes.

200
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,630
So here you can see the clone option.

201
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,730
We have fetch pool and push.

202
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,100
These are the two most important operations that you should know about.

203
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:46,610
And we also have the rebase option and the Create pool request so you can see all of these operations

204
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,260
here.

205
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,980
But you just literally can't visit as kids and you can have all of these options here.

206
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,150
That's really cool about this fetch here.

207
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,100
This is just a part of the pool operation.

208
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:07,590
So when you use the pool operation you get the data and then merge it on your for example your master

209
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:16,100
or branch but Fich just gets the data from the server from the central repository.

210
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,060
So don't worry about this fetch here.

211
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,050
We just need to work on the push and the pool.

212
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:28,470
So now let's go ahead and click on push and here it's going to add to changes to our Master branch.

213
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,350
So here it is no come selector.

214
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,960
So first we need to commit our changes remember.

215
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:40,880
So here this green icon here and see if I click on it here it says that we have a new commit.

216
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,470
We have a new code.

217
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,710
It is actually highlighting it in a green color.

218
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:52,110
So here let's actually change this message and say that my first message.

219
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,120
And then just go ahead and you can't.

220
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,760
You can just click on commit and then push it later.

221
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,730
Or you can come commit and push.

222
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,120
So I'm going to ask if he can commit and then I need to go ahead and can he can Vizier's kids and then

223
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,010
push.

224
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,260
So now we have this my first message coming here.

225
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,270
This is the snapshot of the project of the fight that is actually changed.

226
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,790
And I just need to click on push now.

227
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,180
It says that the push is successful.

228
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,300
So if you want to you can also go ahead and use the pool operation.

229
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,950
So.

230
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,490
Yes.

231
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,310
And go to get and then click on pool.

232
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,450
Now it says here it is that gets route.

233
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,020
So this is the address of my project in my computer.

234
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,230
Here it is the address of the remote repository.

235
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,990
And then it's here it is Raymie the branches to merge that Master branch.

236
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,490
And here we have the strategy so don't forget about this one here.

237
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,190
You just literally can pool and then it's going to pull the project from the remote repository and it's

238
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,690
going to be injected automatically into my project kit and really stood you to this path.

239
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,310
So you don't have to worry about anything here and here it says pool operation.

240
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,330
So because we have no items here because we haven't changed anything it is already updated.

241
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,520
We can also go ahead and play around with these other options for example branches here.

242
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,850
You can create a new branch if you want.

243
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,530
We have local branches we have remote branches.

244
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,710
You already know what to do about these branches.

245
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,430
So you just need to go ahead and work on these options and just play around with it a little bit.

246
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:37,110
And because you are you are going to use it in all of your projects from now on.

247
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,600
OK.

248
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,160
So this is the end of this section of the course.

249
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,570
You have learned everything you needed to know about get and get help.

250
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,820
Now it's your turn.

251
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:55,170
And again make sure to use good in each and every project that you create.

252
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,000
Really your programming projects.

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,910
So thank you very much for watching.

254
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll see you next.
