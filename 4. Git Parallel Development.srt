00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,850
Hello and welcome to this video in this YouTube video you're going to learn about great parallel development.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,470
So first we need to learn about the branching operation.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,570
So we use branches as pointers to our comets or snapshots.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,100
Remember what I told you about comets when we create a comet we are actually creating a snapshot of

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,590
our project and that snapshot is going to contain all of the updated codes.

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,120
Our project but it is actually the updated project.

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,350
So that is going to be our comet or in other words our snapshots of our project.

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,140
So we have our main branch that is also called the master branch.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:55,600
So remember when we were actually entering our bash coats in our terminal Terminal application or inside

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,620
the bash application we entered the origin master.

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,760
There we were actually referring to the master branch.

12
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:11,290
So the master branch is actually your main project your main code.

13
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,860
First we have the main branch or the main project.

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,150
Next we have something called working on a new feature.

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,580
So for example you are working on a chat application and you want to add up for example voice chat feature

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,440
to your app.

17
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,790
So in that case this means that you want to add a new feature to your application.

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,700
And in this case we recommend that you do not mess up with the main branch that is going to be your

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,350
main project because you want to add a new feature and this feature can cause a little bit of problems.

20
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,140
Or maybe it can cause a buck inside the main project.

21
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:04,720
So first you want to make sure that this feature works perfectly and then you want to add this project.

22
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,190
Is this a new feature to your main branch.

23
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:19,200
So in this case we are going to create a new branch in order to work on the project that is called parallel

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,450
development.

25
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,140
So we have two branches which is fine.

26
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,750
The first one is the main branch.

27
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:33,710
The second branch is also our main project our project but we want to add a new feature to the project.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,930
So in this case we are going to use the parallel development in order to work on the new branch and

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,990
the new feature.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,790
And then when it works fine and we know that it works perfectly we are going to add this feature to

31
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,900
the main branch.

32
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,100
So in this case we do not mess up with the main branch or the autogen mass there.

33
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,840
So we create our new plant from a comet or snapshot.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,900
So remember what they told you about comets.

35
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,390
Right.

36
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,110
We create a climate and or a snapshot.

37
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,400
So if we create a new branch there in order to add the new feature.

38
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,900
So now let's be clear about the kinds of branches.

39
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,870
We have two kinds of branches.

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:28,440
The first one is the local branches views local branches inside our local system or workspace that can

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,040
be used in our local repository.

42
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,520
In other words the local branches are actually local to our computer or the local repository that we

43
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,950
are working with the same kind.

44
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,170
Is there a remote tracking branches.

45
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,060
So it is just a connection between the local repository and the central repository the remote tracking

46
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,590
branches.

47
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,330
It's just going to connect to that local repository to the central repository.

48
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,420
So now let's go ahead and learn about branches practically.

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,100
So here on Windows we have these kids Passhe application.

50
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,650
If you are using Macs you need to use the terminal application after installing the kids.

51
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,290
So now if you just go ahead and open the file they're going to right click here and then click on get

52
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,330
past here.

53
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:26,170
So if you're using Mac you just need to manually just change the direction to this folder to the folder

54
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,380
that is named as Android desiccate.

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,450
So the first thing that you can see here is this mass there inside the prentices dismasted keyboard.

56
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,530
This means that we are currently working on the master of branch.

57
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:48,640
So in this way we can understand that currently we are working on which branch.

58
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,850
So for now it is master.

59
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:01,090
So in order to create our new branch we just simply needs to type in here get branch

60
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,790
make sure that you don't have to type it here and then space.

61
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:15,560
So next we just need to put the name of the branch you can name it whatever you want but make sure that

62
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,690
this is a meaningful name.

63
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,940
So this is going to be our first branch.

64
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm going to just put to put here if we.

65
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,420
So this F. B stands for first branch and I'm going to press an entity on my keyboard.

66
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,800
So let's see what happens.

67
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,520
So now the first branch is created.

68
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,690
So now let me tell you something about this new branch that we created here.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,360
This new branch is actually from the master branch or in other words.

70
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,760
This first branch that we created here is originated from the master branch.

71
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,960
This means that it contains all the codes of the master branch.

72
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:04,420
In other words it is just a clone of our main project but there is something different here.

73
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,630
You can see that we are still inside the master branch so it can be a little bit confusing but that's

74
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,190
OK.

75
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,740
This means that we need to switch to the new branch that we created here.

76
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:24,190
So in order to see to the new branch we just need to have been here get check out space and then the

77
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,990
name of the branch.

78
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:32,350
So if we make sure that is the name that you are referring to is exactly the same name that you created

79
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,040
that you set for the new branch.

80
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,900
So so mine is F.P. and I'm going to press the Enter key on my keyboard in order to see what happens.

81
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,150
So now it says switched to branch if B.

82
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,170
And here you can see inside the prentices.

83
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,190
It says if B.

84
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,430
So hopefully that makes sense.

85
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,810
So now let's go ahead and create a new job a file inside our Android dash gets folder.

86
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,590
So I'm going to type in here touch so because I'm using the Unix command.

87
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,550
That's why this command works here in windows inside the special application.

88
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,480
So touch and then space and then the name of the file.

89
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,880
So I'm going to name it as more of my Java and then pass on and take you on your keyboard.

90
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,250
So if you go ahead and open the Android that's good for there we should see this file here.

91
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:32,400
So here it is our job are fine and I'm going to open this file more by that Java so inside this file

92
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:38,300
Let's click Create on your class so you'll know that the name of your class must be the name the same

93
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,750
as the name of your file.

94
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,590
So this is going to be the more wide class.

95
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,020
So class more by opening calibrates followed by a closing brace.

96
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,030
So let me go ahead and increase the font size.

97
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,680
So just click on file and if you're using Mac you just need to click on intelligent idea at the top

98
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,020
and then go ahead and click on preferences or settings.

99
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,830
And then here editor forint.

100
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:12,450
So now you can increase the font size here and now inside this class we can also create a new method.

101
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:20,620
So I can't say Puplick so I'm going to type in here in main Mfat that that class this mobile class is

102
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:29,950
going to have so public static Voyt me and then he said the practice's stream.

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,510
Aure the data type of the prime with her and its name is going to be Ogg's.

104
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,630
So I just miss it.

105
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,130
I'm going to say I can hear system thoughts it's the print princeling

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,560
on inside the coats I'm going to type in hello for semicolon.

107
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:02,750
So I'm going to save this project this fight and I'm going to close it OK.

108
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,840
Now let's go back to our bash or the Terminal application.

109
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,010
So now I want to come to my changes my more avoid that job.

110
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:21,090
So first we need to add these more by double 5 to the get index and then we can commit our changes remember.

111
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,540
So first we need to say get it and then we need to refer to the name of our fine.

112
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,650
So Mauboy thought Java and then press on on your keyboard.

113
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,680
So if you type in here get status it should say that we need to commit Disneyfied.

114
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:51,660
So I'm going to say gets commits space dash em and then space inside the double quotes we need to typing

115
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,470
in a message.

116
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,960
So that message is going to be a more vile or I can't say Java.

117
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:08,610
As you can see I actually accidentally pressed on until on my keyboard and it is now it has come it

118
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,460
had this new change.

119
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:17,600
But here I just wanted to let you know that this new change is in the first branch.

120
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,080
It is not added to the master branch yet.

121
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:29,870
OK so say that because I just wanted to with a paint job class Moabite in the first branch.

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,980
So now you get the idea.

123
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,400
So here you can see that it says that it it does change it's actually committed and it says one file

124
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,890
changed here and here you can see the name of the file.

125
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,770
Moabite that Jarboe.

126
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:53,070
So here let me tell you that this the change that we added here is in the first branch or if B.

127
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,580
Right and in them origin master or in the main branch we don't have this change.

128
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,240
So if you type in here l s.

129
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,100
Notice that inside Apprentice's it says if B if you press an integer on your keyboard it's going to

130
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,810
list all of the files that we have in the main branch.

131
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,400
We have to lie in that job on mobile that job and all the other files.

132
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,060
So now let's go ahead and switch to the main branch to the origin master.

133
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,840
So let's just clear this area first because we have lots of code here.

134
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:35,410
I notice that here it says we're in that desktop Android good for there in the first branch.

135
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,210
So now let's go ahead and see what is happening.

136
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,550
What is inside that Master branch.

137
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,770
So I'm going to type in here.

138
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:51,330
Get check out space and then Sui's to that muscle branch so its name is M..

139
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,170
Right.

140
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,300
So now press on until key on your keyboard.

141
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,930
Now we are switched through the branch mass there.

142
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,170
And inside the this is you can see this Master.

143
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,290
Let's go ahead and take an L S.

144
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:13,790
Now we have like Java music that Java and all the other files but we don't have the Mauboy that java

145
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,820
file in the master Brandt's.

146
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,020
So now it's Challenge time.

147
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,210
Your challenge is to go ahead and create a new directory on your desktop and name it as chat app and

148
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:32,480
then create a new file and the name is named as voice chat.

149
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,180
But this voice chat file should be in the new branch.

150
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,530
You can name it whatever you want but it should be added in the new branch and then you can add changes

151
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:51,600
there and then make sure to list the files that you have inside the folder that you are actually adding

152
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,050
that new branch.

153
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,890
That is for the voice chat in the new branch and you are not messing up with the master branch and make

154
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:06,060
sure that inside your master branch you have some other files so that you can see the difference.

155
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,330
So give this challenge a go and good luck.

156
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,410
So now it's time to learn about merging.

157
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,480
So now assume that we have the master branch right so the master branch all told you is the production

158
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,400
ready project.

159
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,220
This is the project that is going to have the updated codes.

160
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,730
It is going to be the project that we are going to for example if it is an Android app.

161
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,630
This is going to be the project that we want to upload to the Google Play store.

162
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,110
So this is the project that we want.

163
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,030
We don't want to mess up.

164
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,240
So now for example its name IIS chat app.

165
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:55,940
Ok now we want to add a new feature called voice chat to the application but we don't want to just interrupt

166
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,420
the master branch.

167
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,170
So now we are creating a new branch and its name is FP.

168
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:09,210
So for example if B stands for first branch the name of the feature is voice chat feature and for example

169
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,320
it is done.

170
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,240
We have successfully added the voice voice chat feature to our application.

171
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,470
So now what.

172
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:27,530
Now it's time to merge back in this feature to our final project to our production ready project by

173
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,830
using the merging operation.

174
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:37,820
OK now that we have the new feature it's time to merge it back to the master branch.

175
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,800
So let's go ahead and let's see how it's done.

176
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,700
So now open your bash application or your terminal application.

177
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,870
If you're using Mac and here make sure that you are in the master branch first.

178
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,660
If you are not.

179
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,410
Make sure to check out the master branch because the master branch is the target.

180
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,510
You want to merge back.

181
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,980
Our first branch to our Master branch.

182
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,430
So make sure that instead Apprentice's it is mass there and here the command that we are going to use

183
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:15,440
is get marriage and then the name of the branch so the name of our branch is.

184
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:23,950
If the so before I before I press Enter key on my keyboard just take a look at these lists.

185
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,760
Here we have the line and all of these files.

186
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,570
But we don't have more why the java file inside the master branch.

187
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,110
I'm going to execute this command by pressing on my key on my keyboard.

188
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,420
Now I'm going to type in here l s in order to see what I have inside there.

189
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,450
M. branch so not.

190
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,540
Is this more by the java file is added to the master branch.

191
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,640
OK so let me clear this area for you.

192
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:02,740
So another important point that I want you to know about is that the first branch still exists.

193
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:10,190
OK we just merged our first branch to our Master branch but the first branch still exists and you can

194
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:16,010
check out to the first branch and if you want to you can add new features to your application to your

195
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,800
project and then just made it back into the master branch.

196
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:27,550
So for example I can't say get check out if B.

197
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:35,380
So not inside the prentices you can see that via checked out or you are switched to their branch.

198
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:42,070
And then we can go ahead and open the Android Dashti there and then go ahead and open them more while

199
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,780
the Java fight next.

200
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,070
Let's go ahead and modify this file.

201
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,470
So I'm going to add one more line of code here.

202
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,980
One more statement and this time I'm going to say Hollywood word.

203
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:05,020
So now let's go ahead and save this project and close it and then we can go ahead to our Basche application

204
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,800
or the terminal application and then inside the first branch I'm going to come it's my changes.

205
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:21,980
But here let me tell you that because we just modified our already existing Java find inside this android

206
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,640
that dasht get full there.

207
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:31,910
We don't have to necessarily at our file today get index because it is all of the data we just modified

208
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,650
it.

209
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:39,480
So in order to commit our change we can just say kids commit dash

210
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,120
dash em.

211
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,820
So I know that we use this command in order to add multiple files to the index.

212
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:58,560
But here because we have already this file inside a folder and we just modify it then I'm going to use

213
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,880
this dash 8 here in order to also add these change to the index to the get indexed so we don't have

214
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,010
to type in here to get ADD and then the name of the file.

215
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,800
But using this dash 8.

216
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:19,410
We are already also adding this change to the get index and also commenting it gets by using dash M

217
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,750
and then inside the double quotes.

218
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:31,230
I can say modified the more about the Java fight inside the first branch and then person until January

219
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,390
but in order to execute this command.

220
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,600
Now if I type in here get status.

221
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,150
Now here you can see that it says that on branch if b nothing to come in.

222
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:48,420
So it is already committed here you can see it says modified at the moment that justified inside the

223
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,930
first branch.

224
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,130
So this is actually the message so I have a typo here also.

225
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,840
And here you can see that it has modified the movement wide that Java find inside the first branch.

226
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,590
So hopefully that makes sense.

227
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:08,130
And now we can go ahead and Mitsch back our first branch to our origin master to our origin branch or

228
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:16,570
the master branch how first you need to check out to our Master branch the master branch is that destination.

229
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,140
So I'm going to say get check out.

230
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,220
And then the name of the branch which is the master now in say the Prentice's it says master.

231
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,850
Now I'm going to go ahead and type in here get marriage.

232
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:39,930
I'm going to merge back our first branch to L.M. branch so it gets merge if the done.

233
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,930
Now here it says updating.

234
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,490
Now our changes are done and it's just one file changed.

235
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,910
So I just cleared this area for you so you can see what's going on here Beder.

236
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,210
Here you can see that we are still inside the master branch but how do you know that something is changed.

237
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,320
How do I know what is modified actually.

238
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,190
So we have a comment for that.

239
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,310
You just need to type in here.

240
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,520
Cat space.

241
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,920
And in the name of the file.

242
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,360
So of what it is more by DOT Java Java.

243
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,700
Find some that Java.

244
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,310
So here let me tell you that you must be inside this directory and really Dasch get.

245
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,110
And in the massive branch so that you can see that what is changed inside the master branch and then

246
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,970
press enter on your keyboard.

247
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:35,810
So here we have the class mobile and inside this class we have the Smurfette and we have these two lines

248
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,220
of code.

249
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,530
But the second line of code system that ousted princeling.

250
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:47,540
It is added in the last update so you can see that it every team is committed perfectly and you can

251
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,270
also use this command in another branch.

252
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:56,840
For example in your first branch or a B you can use this command in order to see what is actually modified

253
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,910
and then decide whether you want to marriage back that change that branch to your master or branch or

254
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,390
not.

255
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:05,920
So you can't.

256
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:11,810
You just need to use chat and then the name of the file that you have changed or modified so now that

257
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,260
you have learned about the merging operation it's Challenge time.

258
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:24,440
Go ahead and add that voice chat feature that you have created in the last challenge.

259
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,900
Go ahead and merge that into your master branch.

260
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,500
So good luck.

261
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:38,630
So now that we have learnt about the merging operation it's time to learn about the rebase operation.

262
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:46,240
So the rebase operation does actually the same job the same task as the merging does.

263
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,820
OK but in a different way in a linear manner.

264
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:57,680
So based on my own experience it's better to learn about the rebasing operation practically.

265
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,100
So let's go ahead and open our bash for Terminal application.

266
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,050
Let's see what is actually rebasing.

267
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,580
So first let's clear this area and then let's Sui's to the first branch.

268
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,810
So I'm going to type in here.

269
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:16,020
Get check out it the.

270
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,310
Now let's go ahead and open our Android that is fine and I'm going to go ahead.

271
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,430
And here we can either create the next device.

272
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,340
But if you want to create jobs files you can do it here in your bash or terminal application.

273
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,690
So I'm going to type in here touch and then the name of the file.

274
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,520
So the first one is going to be a boxer Dart's Java file and another file Let's go ahead and say touch

275
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,490
each boxer dot Java.

276
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,540
OK.

277
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,620
Now if you go ahead and open your folder you should see these two files the set and the kickboxer.

278
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,390
And then let's go ahead and open the box file.

279
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,990
So here we don't have to create a class.

280
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,960
I just want to modify this fine sand going out and tell a value.

281
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:12,260
I can say DCs Boxer and then save is fine clothes it's next go ahead and open the kickboxer file.

282
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,070
And here let's also modify this file.

283
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:21,300
So this is kickboxer save it and then close it OK.

284
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,960
Now let's go back to our Flash application.

285
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:31,850
So here make sure that you are already inside the first branch and then to create these two files the

286
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,680
boxes and the kickboxer.

287
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,970
So now that we created these two files we need to add these two files to get indexed so we have multiple

288
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,840
files here right.

289
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:51,840
So you need to say get space dash get space at dash and then a capitol a.

290
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,150
This is very important.

291
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:01,910
Get app space dash Capitol a because we have multiple files you want to add multiple files to the index.

292
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:08,350
So I'm going to present to the German Keeble get status.

293
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,970
So here it says that we have these two files and we need to commit them.

294
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:20,760
So I'm going to say get space come eat space dash 8.

295
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,230
We have multiple flights right.

296
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,400
We want to commit all of these flights.

297
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:35,680
So that's why I said that lowercase leader a space dash him space and an inside double quotes the message.

298
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:44,920
So I'm going to say Boxer and teach Boxer Dobber files.

299
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:54,480
It's next let's go ahead and execute this command by pressing the Enter key on our keyboard.

300
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,440
So here you can see that it has two files changed.

301
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:06,050
We are inside the first branch so I can say good status in order to see that it says nothing to it.

302
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,110
So everything works fine.

303
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,760
So let's clear this area.

304
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:15,960
So now if you go ahead and type in here it's inside the first branch we have two new Newfies boxes that

305
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,780
Java and kickboxer Java.

306
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:25,760
But if you go ahead and type in here get check out to the master branch and type in here.

307
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:31,510
And as you can see that we don't have their boxer and kickboxer double points here.

308
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,830
So let's go back let's go ahead and switch to the first branch.

309
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:43,560
So good checkout if we are going to say that we are inside the first branch and I'm going to type in

310
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,920
here.

311
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:50,420
Get space replace M..

312
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,950
So notice that you are inside the first branch and we are using this command to get rebase master so.

313
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,590
So now let's go ahead and press on until you are on a keyboard and let's see what happens.

314
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,730
So now it says the current branch if B is up to date.

315
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:15,410
So this means that now that we've replaced our first branch to our Master branch now it is up to date

316
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:20,260
that everything that we have inside the master master branch is actually inside the first branch.

317
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,910
That's why it says it is up to date.

318
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,370
So now let's go ahead and let's switch to the master branch.

319
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,210
So now I am inside the master branch.

320
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
I just clear this area for you.

321
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,660
So in order to suit to the master branch you know what to do get checked out and then the name of the

322
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,840
branch.

323
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,520
Now I am going to do the same command in reverse order.

324
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:49,990
I'm going to say get notice that I am inside the master of range gets rebase and then this time I'm

325
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:57,190
going to be fair to my first branch or F. B and then press on into the key on your keyboard.

326
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:05,740
So now let's see what what's happening it says first rebinding head to replay your work on top of it.

327
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,750
Fast forward that master to the.

328
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:16,830
So this means that it is actually adding all of the commits of the first branch to the head of the master

329
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,630
branch.

330
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,220
So this is the same as the merging operation but it is doing it in a linear order.

331
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:30,750
So in this way the advantage of using rebase operation is that we have less branches and everything

332
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,310
is done linearly.

333
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,230
And I think rebase is better but you can use whatever you want.

334
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,390
You can either use marriage or rebase.

335
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:46,800
So now that we are inside the master branch if I type in here and S and press on energy on my keyboard

336
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,770
you can see that you have the boxer and the kickboxer that job afarid inside the master right.

337
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,520
So it's works perfectly.

338
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,810
So now it's challenge time.

339
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,070
Go ahead and create a new feature.

340
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,850
This means I mean you need to create on your file and you want to add the emoji feature to your chat

341
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,740
app.

342
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,910
So you want to create a new job find.

343
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,860
It doesn't matter what you put in the inside the file.

344
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:21,360
Just go ahead and name it as emoji and you want to add this feature to your chat application so that

345
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:30,720
your chat app can use emojis and then try to use that rebase operation in order marriage.

346
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,810
Your featured your file to your master branch.

347
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,280
So give this challenge Ekko and good luck.

348
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,620
So now let's go ahead and push all of these changes to the central repository

349
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,450
and here this is my web browser My central repository.

350
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,660
Good hop.

351
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,320
And if you go ahead and make sure that you are locked in first.

352
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,220
So if you click on your profile you should see your repositories option.

353
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,370
If you click on it.

354
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,810
So now here it is our repositories.

355
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,890
You can also enter this you aren't have that com slash your username in order to see the repositories.

356
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,990
So here we have the hello dashboard.

357
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:16,680
If you click on it here it is for example our repository here if you want to you can go ahead and create

358
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,830
a new repository here.

359
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:25,680
So the most important point that I want you to know about is that here it is our repository.

360
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,360
Hello world.

361
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:32,940
Right so this means that everybody in the good hop community has access to this project they can go

362
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:41,430
ahead and download our project and for example if you want two other people to access this project and

363
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:48,390
in that case then it's going to cause problems because others can mess up with our project or our repository

364
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,270
and they can push for example buggy codes or whatever to our project.

365
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,120
So we don't want that to happen.

366
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:02,770
We want to create access rights here so here you can see that we have this clone or download option.

367
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,970
If I click on it here we have a new option it says use s s h.

368
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,630
If you click on this one.

369
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:17,660
Now here it is used as s s h key and passphrase from account.

370
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,130
So let's go ahead and copy this link.

371
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,970
I'm going to click on this icon in order to copy it.

372
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,900
Now let's go ahead and open our bash application.

373
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,020
So because of the access rights thing that I told you about.

374
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,050
First we need to generate an S S H key.

375
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:44,700
So just type in here s s h dash key gen S-sh dash kitchen and then person on your keyboard.

376
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:53,440
So now it says generating Puplick slash private or as a key pair unterrified in which to save the key.

377
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,600
So here it is the address of the file that it is going to save the key.

378
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,460
C users.

379
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:05,160
The name of your user name of the computer that S-sh slash ID on the line or state.

380
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,370
So I'm going to press on until he again on my keyboard.

381
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,290
Now it says create a directory.

382
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:17,970
So here it is the directory in order to find the S-sh key fine and then it says Enter passphrase and

383
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,100
it is empty for no passphrase.

384
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,230
So if you want to specify a passphrase you can enter it here.

385
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:30,220
So I'm going to enter it here and then as you can see as I'm writing my passphrase here it is not as

386
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,880
showing me here letters or even little circles so it is more secure.

387
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,550
So don't worry if you are not seeing what is happening here you just need to enter the passphrase and

388
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,640
unprecedented on your keyboard.

389
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:52,440
So now it says your identification has been saved in this file in this address and your public key has

390
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,590
been saved in this address.

391
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:00,510
The key fingerprint is this one so hopefully that makes sense.

392
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:07,010
And this means that RSS has key is now generated and now we can go ahead and use it.

393
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:14,910
And also if you want to see the content of your SSN key file then you can just go ahead and type in

394
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,320
here.

395
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,980
The cats comment and then just paste this address here.

396
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,810
If it's me I need to type it here again.

397
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,660
So the Control-C doesn't fall here I'm going to right click on it and then click on copy.

398
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,010
So Chad and I see the here paste.

399
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,680
So then press on until you are on your keyboard.

400
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:43,020
So now here it is the S-sh keep my public S-sh key so hopefully that makes sense.

401
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:48,710
So now that we are we have this S-sh key so make sure that you are using these thought pop the public

402
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,360
key that we need to use on here.

403
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,460
Now that we have this key we need to go ahead and added to our GitHub.

404
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,610
So let's go ahead and first copy it is key.

405
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,070
I'm going to select it and then click on copy and then go back to get up and here click on your profile

406
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,090
and then click on settings.

407
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,710
Next go ahead and click on S S H and Peachi keys.

408
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:22,420
First of in if you click on new S-sh key and then we need to provide a title and then we need to paste

409
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,460
the excesses there.

410
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,070
So let's wait a little bit here.

411
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,490
So the title is going to be for example I'm going to say hello world.

412
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,770
S-sh Kee and then I'm going to paste the key here.

413
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,700
So now I'm going to click on at S-sh key.

414
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:49,230
So now it is asking me to enter the password of my account in good hub so that we can continue to just

415
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,240
enter the password and then click and confirm passport.

416
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,810
So here it is R S S H key.

417
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,300
To get hub.

418
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,750
This is the list of essences keys associated with your account.

419
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,600
If you want to you can remove them.

420
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,380
So now let's go ahead and open our bag.

421
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,920
So here it is here.

422
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,600
Actually it is a little bit crowded just typing here clear.

423
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:16,060
So now that we have put the S-sh key in the getup now we need to authenticate.

424
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,760
So just typing here.

425
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:28,670
S s h space dash capital-T space gets at sign gets hard that's come.

426
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,440
OK.

427
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,110
And then press on until key on your keyboard.

428
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,170
So let's wait a little bit here.

429
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,100
Now it says the authenticity of hostes can be established.

430
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,430
Arest a key fingerprint is this one.

431
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,840
So are you sure you want to continue connecting.

432
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,160
So we trust gets Hopp here.

433
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,200
So I'm going to just step in here.

434
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,640
Yes so it says yes or no.

435
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,610
I'm going to enter the yes and then press on into the key on my keyboard.

436
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:01,680
It has permanently added Get hup to the list of known hosts and it has entered a passphrase for this

437
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:01,990
key.

438
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,640
So remember that the passphrase that if we needed to specify for our S-sh keep and we could also specify

439
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,720
an empty string value an empty value for the password.

440
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,360
So if you specify a value for the passport you need to type it here.

441
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,730
The passphrase actually.

442
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,840
So I'm going to type in here.

443
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,440
My passport.

444
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,920
So you might not see the passport here.

445
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,190
Don't for it just intellect and unprecedented here on your keyboard we have a new message here it says

446
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:39,310
Hi this is my username you've successfully authenticated but kit but get hub does not provide shell

447
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,860
access.

448
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,070
Don't worry about this one.

449
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,790
Now that we are successfully authenticated we can go ahead and push our changes to get hub.

450
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:54,770
So remember always use S-sh key in order to secure your repository in getopt because we don't want anyone

451
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,640
else to mess up with our repository.

452
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:06,130
So now if you go to the up here you can see we have this blackout here in the S-sh keys.

453
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,530
If I go ahead and refresh this page let's see what happens.

454
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,580
Now this key is in green color.

455
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,070
This means that we are successfully authenticated.

456
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:25,670
So now here let me tell you that we can also have a new branch in our central repository so that we

457
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:33,200
not actually interrupt or interfere with our main branch in the get up and we can have a new branch

458
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,810
for our own and maybe we can name it as new features or whatever.

459
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:45,620
Or if you are actually in a team of developers then you can have your own branch there and everyone

460
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,500
will know that this is your for example your branch and you are working on your branch and you have

461
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,460
not decided to merge your branch to the master branch yet.

462
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,560
So you can have that here too.

463
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,240
So let's go ahead and let's see how it works.

464
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,480
First of all not now that we are in the sitting space here you can see that we have this option.

465
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,920
It says repositories if you click on it we can see our repository here.

466
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,410
Hello.

467
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,960
If I click on it here.

468
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,830
Now we are guided to this page.

469
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,820
And now here we have something called branch and currently it is master.

470
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:27,820
If you click on it we can see that here you can create a new branch if you enter the name of your branch.

471
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,090
You can just go ahead and create it.

472
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:38,020
But let's go ahead and create our branch in the command line application because it is much more professional.

473
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,450
And it is much more better.

474
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,690
So let's go ahead and open our bash or our terminal application.

475
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,360
So here first let's go ahead and clear this area.

476
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:57,880
So because we want to have a new branch inside a central repository here inside dispatch application

477
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,710
let's go ahead and so each to their first branch so I'm going to type in here get checked out and then

478
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,670
the name of the branch.

479
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:14,500
So if the and in here I'm going to notice that instead Apprentice's it's true you should say the name

480
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,520
of your branch.

481
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,970
So next step in here is push space origin space.

482
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:30,360
Now before we used mass there right now we're going to just refer to the name of our branch which is

483
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:37,370
going to be iffy and then press on Enter key on your keyboard in order to execute this command.

484
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,220
So here it says origin.

485
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
So it says the origin does not exist.

486
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,100
I have a typo here.

487
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,810
So I'm going to enter my command again.

488
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,630
Get push

489
00:38:51,690 --> 00:39:02,880
and origin if the now let's wait a little bit here so here it says enumerating objects 14.

490
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,930
And it says Don.

491
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:12,270
So here you can see that it says Create a pull request for if be an get.

492
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,630
By visiting this you Ardell.

493
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:21,940
So now you can notice that we have a new branch inside our central repository.

494
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:30,310
So if you go ahead and you go to your central repository here it says your recently pushed branches

495
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,100
here we have the B.

496
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,610
If I click on this if the.

497
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,830
Now here it is our FP branch.

498
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,470
So here it is branch if B.

499
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,220
Right.

500
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,580
We are not inside the master branch anymore.

501
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:48,760
We have two branches the first one is the master and we have also the piece of your code inside the

502
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,680
first branch.

503
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,290
So inside the first branch we have all of these files.

504
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,460
We have the box.

505
00:39:54,730 --> 00:40:02,240
Kickboxer Laia immobile read me all of these files and if I switch to the master branch you can see

506
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,690
that we only have the music of job fine and they read me that in the file.

507
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,380
So now hopefully you get the idea.

508
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,450
Now we can go ahead and so is today.

509
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,650
M. branch.

510
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,050
So here let's first clear this area and I'm going to type in here.

511
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,070
Good.

512
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,330
Check out master.

513
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:32,000
And then just step in here gets push space origin Masterson make sure that inside Apprentice's it says

514
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,110
Master that this means that we are currently inside the master branch.

515
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:42,560
And then I just need to push my changes to that master branch in a central repository.

516
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,340
So I'm going to press on and three key on my keyboard.

517
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,060
The process is finished.

518
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,410
If you go back to your central repository and here the branch is master.

519
00:40:52,730 --> 00:41:01,580
So here make sure that branch is master and make sure to first refresh this page and then you can see

520
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,180
these changes.

521
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:08,420
You can see that all of your files are added to the master branch and you can also switch to the first

522
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,140
branch or your F B and you can see these files here.

523
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,170
So hopefully that makes sense.

524
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:24,730
So the final important point that you want to talk about here is about going back to the previous change.

525
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:32,010
So let's go ahead and open our folder and write test kits and for example go ahead and open the mobile

526
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,970
that Java find here.

527
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:40,480
I want to add another change I want to add another line of code to my main effort and paste it here.

528
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,510
And this time I want to say or let's say everyone.

529
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:48,710
So let's save this file and then close our project.

530
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:55,250
And then let's end there because I want to see the contents of my mobile that fight.

531
00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:01,620
So Chatz Mauboy thought Java.

532
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,370
So here you can see the content.

533
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,720
And here you can see this line of code everyone.

534
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:12,200
So for example I don't like this new change that I added to my mobile that are fine and I want to go

535
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,900
back to the previous version of this file.

536
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:21,710
So now that we have changed our file you know that first we need to commit our changes and then we can

537
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,190
decide whether we liked our change or not.

538
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:31,880
Or in that case we can decide that we want to go back to the previous version or previous snapshot because

539
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,460
what I told you about snapshot or comments is that we have the updated or in other words we have a snapshot

540
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,130
that contains the most updated code.

541
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:49,230
So now we don't have that snapshot and this means that we cannot go back to the previous comment.

542
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:58,120
So first we need to create a comment I'm going to say get it because we have only modified our file.

543
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,700
We can say dash a space dash em and then two coats.

544
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:10,790
And then I can say modified more by the age of a fight two coats and then press enter on your keyboard.

545
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:20,870
So next go ahead and use this command get log in order to just put the lugs inside the command line

546
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,600
tool.

547
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:31,780
So next you have the lugs and then you need to find the specific log that is related to the previous

548
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,640
changes of your file.

549
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,810
So for example in this case our file is more than that of a file.

550
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:44,590
So I want to roll back to the previous changes so you need to take a look at the logs and see version

551
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,430
of the file you want to roll back to.

552
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,350
So here for example you have the date.

553
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,040
So for example I want to go back to these two the changes that I made at this hour.

554
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,860
Right.

555
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,450
So you just need to find that specific date and find that specific commit here you can see the commit

556
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:08,870
and then you can go ahead and copy the first 8 digits of this hexadecimal code.

557
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:19,180
So one two three four five six seven eight capitis the first eight hex decimal digits and then go back

558
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,820
to the bash file or the Terminal application.

559
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,950
So here you just need to enter get.

560
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,420
So make sure that you are inside this and retested directory.

561
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,380
I am inside the master branch.

562
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:40,220
So get check out space and then you need to paste the hexadecimal code here.

563
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,390
Space.

564
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,800
And then the name of the file.

565
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:51,090
So it is more byde that Joe and then present it on your keyboard.

566
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:59,270
Now let's go ahead and let's see what is the content of our mobile device are cats more ways that Java.

567
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,630
So here you can see now we are rolled back to this version of the file.

568
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,040
We don't have that specific line of code that we had at here.

569
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:14,020
We added here because we wanted to go back to the previous comment.

570
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,540
Now here you can see this line of code.

571
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,650
This means that you are rolled back to the previous version of this file and everything is working perfectly.

572
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:28,650
But remember these changes can only be rolled back if you commit your changes.

573
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,030
OK.

574
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,280
We have snapshots of our project.

575
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:37,840
So for example you create a snapshot and later you know that's all you'll find out that that specific

576
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,300
change is not working and you want to roll back to the commit period to the previous comment.

577
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,070
So you just go ahead and use this come and get checked out.

578
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:54,700
And then at their first digits of the hexadecimal code of the commits that you want to roll back to

579
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,460
and then the name of the fight more by that.

580
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,360
In this case and then everything will be working fine.

581
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:07,180
So make sure to use this cat's command in order to always check your content of your file and see that

582
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,820
everything is working perfectly.

583
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,250
So let's see what we have learned so far in this video.

584
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:19,060
We have learned about Padel and development but overall we have learned about the working space.

585
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:27,190
The project that you're working on and then we add our changes to the staging area the index get index

586
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,540
and then we have the local repository.

587
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,750
So for example because it's our changes.

588
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:41,050
So that's why we need the local repository so that we have these snapshots of our project and then we

589
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:46,000
have the remote repository that is actually our central repository.

590
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:54,390
In this case it is getup and we use the push pull operations in order to push our changes to our remote

591
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:02,530
repository or we use the pool operation to pool our tune changes back from the remote's repository.

592
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:10,030
So this is really all we have learned about parallel development about the branching concept.

593
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,210
We also learned about merging and rebasing.

594
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:20,940
And then finally we could actually push all of our changes to the remote repository.

595
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:29,500
So in the next year two or three of we are going to learn how to integrate the kit to Android studio.

596
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,420
So I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
